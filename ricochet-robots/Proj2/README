___________________________________________________________________


This solution is based in SMT, it creates different descriptions for the problem for different number of time steps and solve them, searching for the least number of times steps. This search starts growing exponentially and when it finds a satisfiable solution it uses binary search to find the least number of steps.  

It uses Z3 as solver and Python as programming language.

It runs in Linux systems.
